This App was created as part of the Zero-to-Mastery Udemy Course. This is my first full stack web app creation.

Fully deployed on Heroku: https://kw-smartbrain.herokuapp.com/

This App utilizes the ClarifAI API to determine where the faces are in the picture and if they are any celebrities. You can also securely register a profile to keep track of the number of images you have checked and allows for Profile deletion.
